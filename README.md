# CleanSV ( Version 1 )

**CleanSV** is a simple, AI-powered web tool that helps you clean CSV / Excel files the way you want — using plain English.

**Working**
- Upload your dataset (csv / xls / xlsx file)
- Talk to the AI assistant to tell it what changes you’d like (like “drop rows with missing age” or “rename the email column”)
- You will get a code which you can apply and see the results live in the table.
- You can choose to accept or reject each suggestion before it’s applied.
- If you don't like it you can undo /redo your changes with one click
- And once you are done with the changes you can DOWNLOAD your file with 1 click in the same format.


#PS : It works on API calls from OPEN AI , GEMINI , GROK
